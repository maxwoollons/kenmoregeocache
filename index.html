            <h1><u>Kenmore Queensland Australia</u></h1>
            <p>Kenmore is a suburb of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It is located 10 kilometres south-west of the
                Brisbane CBD.
                The suburb was not always as developed as it is today. Back in the year 1840 the area was used for
                cattle
                grazing around the areas of fig tree pocket and Kenmore.
            </p>
            <p>
                European settlement began in the 1840s, lots of land around the Kenmore area where released to the new settlers from britain in 15 to 20 acre lots. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the year 1880 a man named Andrew Todd purchased 100 acres of land in the area. He named the property
                Kenmore Park after his birthplace in Scotland. The name kenmore grew in popularity and was eventually
                used
                to name the suburb.
